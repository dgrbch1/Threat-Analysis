# Cybersecurity Vulnerability Portfolio

This project is a portfolio website showcasing various cybersecurity vulnerabilities (CVEs) and IP analysis. It demonstrates different types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and overflow vulnerabilities, alongside an analysis of several IP addresses with explanations of their security statuses.

## Website Structure

The portfolio website is organized as follows:

- **Home Page**: Provides an overview of the purpose of the site and its focus on cybersecurity.
- **CVE Gallery**: Displays examples of specific vulnerabilities, including images and descriptions of each CVE.
- **IP Address Analysis**: Contains IP addresses for well-known services, with information on their security status and an assurance of no known vulnerabilities for these hosts.
- **Footer**: General information about the website's copyright.

## Features

- **Blind SQL Injection Example**: Illustrates the concept of a SQL injection vulnerability where SQL queries are not properly validated, exposing the application to potential attacks.
- **Overflow Variables and Tags**: Demonstrates the potential security risk associated with handling overflowed variables in tag-based data.
- **IP Analysis**: Includes IP addresses associated with YouTube, Epic Games, Temu, Twitch, and other popular services. Each IP has been reviewed, and no vulnerabilities have been found on these hosts.

## Images Included

The website includes visual examples to aid in understanding different cybersecurity issues:

1. **CVE Images**:
   - Blind SQL Injection vulnerability
   - Overflow Variables and Tags vulnerability
   - Additional SQL injection examples

2. **IP Analysis**:
   - IP addresses and security assessments for services like YouTube, Twitch, Epic Games, Temu, and a sample IP with no CVEs detected.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Code**: Clone the repository or download the ZIP file to your local machine.
2. **Run the Website Locally**: Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the website.
3. **Customization**: Modify the HTML or CSS as desired to add more CVEs, update IP information, or alter the style.

## Project Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the website.
- **images/**: Folder containing the images used in the CVE gallery and IP analysis sections.

## Acknowledgments

- **Shodan**: For IP analysis information.
- **CVE Database**: For reference to common vulnerabilities and exposures.
